    <div class="cont1"><p>Let’s take a trip down memory lane to May 2000. Just another day at the office: You turn <br>
        on your work computer, connect to the internet and download the latest e-mail in the <br>
        Microsoft Outlook client. You immediately notice a strange message with the subject line <br>
        “ILOVEYOU.” A person you know confesses their love to you. Maybe a school friend… Wait, <br>
        no!  Even better — your older supervisor.<br>
        <br>
        Whoever it is, it’s definitely eye-catching, so you click the attached file called “LOVE-LETTER-<br>
        FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS” and… nothing seems to happen. However, sometime later, you discover <br>
        that important documents on your hard disk have been irreparably corrupted, and a bunch of <br>
        similar love letters have been sent out on your behalf — to all of the contacts in your address <br>
        book.</p></div>

        <div class="cont2"><p>Technology has dramatically impacted our society, and many people have been benefiting from <br>
            it in numerous ways. For example, it is now easier to communicate with other people through <br>
            smartphones. Aside from this, it is also possible to quickly send and receive documents via <br>
            email or chat, as well as order food through different delivery apps. In line with this, we can <br>
            say that life with the presence of technology has become quite comfortable and straightforward <br>
            in ways which we could not have imagined.<br>
            <br>
            Artificial intelligence has made it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new <br>
            inputs, and perform human-like tasks. With this, work efficiency has dramatically improved.<br> 
            Furthermore, artificial intelligence can take over repetitive or dangerous tasks, which helps free <br>
            up the human workforce.<br>
            <br>
            In this way, artificial intelligence helps the society achieve optimum productivity as they go <br>
            through their daily lives.</p></div>

            <div class="cont3"><p>Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, is home to a growing technology industry. In recent <br>
                years, the city has seen a significant increase in the number of startups and tech companies, <br>
                and the government has been supportive of initiatives to promote the growth of the industry. <br>
                One of the main factors contributing to the growth of technology in Manila is the country’s <br>
                large population, which provides a large pool of potential consumers and talent. Additionally, <br>
                the government has established several initiatives to promote the growth of the industry, <br>
                including tax incentives for startups and the creation of special economic zones for technology<br> 
                companies.
